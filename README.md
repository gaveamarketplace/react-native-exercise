## Awesome React Native Login

Use your creativity to create a React Native application that only does authentication.

### Requirements

- Welcome Screen
  - Login Screen
  - Register Screen
- You must use styled-components
- You must use React Navigation

Make sure to use best practices when setting up your project. Things like eslint, prettier and editorconfig are well seen.

### Plus

- Work on the UI to make it look good
- Make the authentication work with JWT (You can use Firebase or any public JSON API)
- Redux is not required but you can use it (If you integrate Sagas, even better!)
- Animations
- Semantic Git commits

### Are you finished?

After you finish your test, upload the source code to Github in a private repository and contact your test applier.

Good luck!
