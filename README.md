# Front-end/Mobile Software Test
> A very simple technical test you can take to move forward on your application process.

## Awesome React Native Login

Use your creativity to create a React Native application that only does authentication.

### Requirements

- Welcome Screen
  - Login Screen
  - Register Screen
- You must use styled-components
- You must use React Navigation
- You need to work on the UI to make it look good

Make sure to use best practices when setting up your project. Things like eslint, prettier and editorconfig are well seen.

### Plus

- Make the authentication work with JWT (You can use Firebase or any public JSON API)
- Redux is not required but you can use it (If you integrate Sagas, even better!)
- Animations
- Semantic Git commits

### Are you finished?

After you finish your test, upload the source code to Github in a private repository and give access to @orafaelfragoso so we can review your test.

Good luck!
